1. In this branch, add and commit a change that will accomplish the following:
    1. When a user types a CSS color name in the input field and hits the update button, the "undefined" text in the first h1 should transform into the name of the color entered and the color of the letters should be that color.
    1. When the user clicks the "Disappear" button, everything on the page except the second h1 should disappear and not come back until after a page refresh.
1. Push your branch to the repo when instructed.
